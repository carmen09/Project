      Nezha is a well-known deity from Chinese mythology. Weapons: The Wind Fire
      Wheels (風火輪) and the Fire-tipped Spear(火尖槍). Nezha is often depicted
      as a youth, instead of an adult. He is often shown flying in the sky
      riding on the Wind Fire Wheels (風火輪), has the Universe Ring (乾坤圈)
      around his body (sometimes in his left hand), the Red Armillary Sash
      (浑天绫) around his shoulders and a Fire-tipped Spear (火尖槍) in his
      right hand. Sometimes, he is shown in his "three heads and six arms" form (三頭六臂).
